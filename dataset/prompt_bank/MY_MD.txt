This dataset is a collection of 32 time series derived from a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Each time series (channel) represents the interatomic distance, measured in Angstroms (Å), between a central Iron (Fe) atom and one of 32 distinct Oxygen (O) atoms (from Fe-O163 to Fe-O194). The data captures the physical dynamics of these atomic pairs at a high temporal resolution, where each step corresponds to 1 femtosecond (fs). The series includes complex patterns such as atomic vibrations, bond stretching, and other dynamic interactions. The task is to produce a long-term forecast for all 32 distance channels simultaneously. Given a sequence of past values, predict the distance values for the next 96 femtoseconds (96 steps).
